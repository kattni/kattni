## Meet Kattni!

![Kattni's GitHub Profile Header Image](assets/kattni-github-profile-header-image.png)

I am a mentor, maker, programmer, creator, photographer, one-time gardener, intermittent chef, a loved partner, and I am proud to be a woman in tech. My hobbies overlap significantly with my professional life, but I've learned that it's important to take the time to work on projects for yourself. I am tolerated by two cats who continue to let me live with them.

### Kattni and Adafruit

I am sponsored by [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) to be an open source community leader, technical writer, embedded software developer with the [CircuitPython project](https://circuitpython.org), and embedded hardware designer.

I spend my time with Adafruit maintaining the [CircuitPython libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries), coordinating [new contributors](https://circuitpython.org/contributing), leading the [Adafruit community](https://adafru.it/discord), authoring [guides and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/kattni), and picking up whatever else needs to be done, including sometimes designing hardware [bearing my name](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/5378-01.jpg).

### Kattni's Story

In July 2017, I discovered a passion I had never considered, and it began a series of events that brought me to the amazing place I now find myself. My path began with trying and failing to learn Python, and stumbling into CircuitPython. The moment I made an LED blink, I was hooked. Within two weeks, I completed my first project, and agreed to write a Learn guide for Adafruit explaining how it was built. I joined the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) and began asking a lot of questions. I quickly found myself answering others' questions, and realised that sharing my knowledge was incredibly fulfilling. I began working on [my first CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground). In the middle of September, I made [my first pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/pull/2) to add a new feature, and immediately broke my project code. This led to adding every feature in my project to the library over the next few weeks. My [first guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-express-piano-in-the-key-of-lime) was published in October 2017. In November, I began working part time with Adafruit, and in January 2018, I came on full time as a Creative Engineer. I've learned an incredible amount since I picked up my first microcontroller and wrote my first CircuitPython program. Even though it's where I started, my favorite thing is still making LEDs blink. The blinking is [much fancier now](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation).

### Sponsor Kattni

I am sponsored on GitHub by amazing folks who enable me to further share my knowledge.
