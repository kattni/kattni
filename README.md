## Meet Kattni!

![Kattni's GitHub Profile Header Image](assets/kattni-github-profile-header-image.png)

I am a mentor, maker, programmer, creator, photographer, one-time gardener, intermittent chef, a loved partner, and I am proud to be a woman in tech. My hobbies overlap significantly with my professional life, but I've learned that it's important to take the time to work on projects for yourself. I am tolerated by two cats who continue to let me live with them.

If you're interested in the story of me getting to this point, check out my [About page](https://kattni.com/about).

### Current Employment

I am sponsored by [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) to be an open source community leader, technical writer, embedded software developer with the [CircuitPython project](https://circuitpython.org), and embedded hardware designer.

I spend my time with Adafruit maintaining the [CircuitPython libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries), coordinating [new contributors](https://circuitpython.org/contributing), leading the [Adafruit community](https://adafru.it/discord), authoring [guides and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/kattni), and picking up whatever else needs to be done, including sometimes designing hardware [bearing my name](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/5378-01.jpg).

### Sponsor Kattni on GitHub

I am sponsored on GitHub by amazing folks who enable me to further share my knowledge.
